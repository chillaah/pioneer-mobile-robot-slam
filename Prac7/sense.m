function Z = sense(I)
% for week 7 task, detect IDs only
% input: I is an RGB image of the robot's view
% output: Z = 1xn where n is the number of beacons in the image.

%for week 8 task, detect IDs and estimate range and bearing
% input: I is an RGB image of the robot's view
% output: Z = nx3 where Z(i,:) = [id range bearing] (bearing should be in degrees)
