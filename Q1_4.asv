function wheelVel = vel2wheels(vel)
    % Inputs:
    % vel is the velocity vector (v, omega) in units of metres/s and radians/s
    % Return:
    % wheelVel is the wheel velocity vector (vleft, vright) each in the range -100 to +100 to achieve
    % this velocity
    
    radiusWheel = 0.0975;

    vel(1) = v;
    vel(2) = omega;

    vleft = (2*v - omega*robotAxleLength)/(2*radiusWheel);
    vright = (2*v + omega*robotAxleLength)/(2*radiusWheel);
    
    wheelVel = [vleft vright];
    
    % capping
    wheelVel(wheelVel < -100) = -100;
    wheelVel(wheelVel > 100) = 100;
end

function vel = wheels2vel(wheelVel)
    % Inputs:
    % wheelVel is the wheel velocity vector (vleft, vright) each in the range -100 to +100
    % Return:
    % vel is the resulting velocity vector (v, omega) in units of metres/s and radians/s

function qd = qdot(q, vel)
    % Inputs:
    % q is the configuration vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians
    % vel is the velocity vector (v, omega)
    % Return:
    % qd is the vector (xdot, ydot, thetadot) in units of metres/s and radians/s
    
    vel(1) = v;
    vel(2) = omega;

function qnew = qupdate(q, vel, dt)
    % Inputs:
    % q is the configuration vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians
    % vel is the velocity vector (v, omega)
    % dt is the length of the integration timestep in units of seconds
    % Return:
    % qnew is the new configuration vector vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians at the
    % end of the time interval.
end

function vel = control(q, point)
    % Inputs:
    % q is the initial configuration vector (x, y, theta) in units of metres and radians
    % point is the vector (x, y) specifying the goal point of the robot
